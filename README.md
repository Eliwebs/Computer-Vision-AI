Computer vision to recognize handwritten numbers


To test our own handwritten digits and labels dataset, you must first download the Painted_Images folder and Painted_Labels file from Github to your local machine.

After downloading the folder and file, the "IMG_pathdirectory" variable on line 142 must be changed to the correct path for the Painted_Images folder on your local machine.

Similarly, the "Label_pathdirectory" variable on line 164 must be changed to the correct path for Painted_Labels on your local machine.


After this, to run the program simply run Computer_Vision.py
